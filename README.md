  dev mistakes
</h1>

## What this is
An archive of mistakes devs make in the job search and on job. Learn so you can avoid the same.

## Reason for this repo
There is enough documentation of success, a lot of "how I joined a top notch company", "how to ace an interview" but very little about mistakes devs have made along their journeys. Let's document mistakes so people following the same paths can try to do better from the start.

## 1. Selection of Tech Stack
MERN | MEAN | Ruby on Rails | Python/Flask | Python/Django | Java/Spring Boot | Kotlin/Spring Boot | Flutter -> The list goes on.
### üî∂ Reason for selection

There are several reasons why devs select the stack they end up using - a few of those reasons include: <br />

- Ease of learning - You want to build something fast
- Size and activity of community behind the stack - You will get stuck building projects because of a bug, no idea how to do something etc. Whatever the reason, the community can determine how fast you find answers.
- Demand for the stack - opportunities and consequently money come into the mix. You want to learn something that will help you get a job fast.
- What you want to build - If you want to build mobile apps, you are in luck because the options are few. But if you want to build for the web, the options can be overwhelming.
- Fun - Many of us have learned things just because they are fun. That's the reason I tried out Python and Kotlin ( fun syntax )

- [Have More Reasons? Consider contributing to this repo]

Make sure you learn the right stack depending on which reason weighs most for you. If you are looking for a fruitful financially stable career, choose a stack that will give you the best opportunities for that. 

[
  It may be hard to learn but it would be worth it in the long run - for this reason, I should have started with Java/Spring Boot way earlier in my career instead of going for python. Don't get me wrong, Python is great but timing for learning it wasn't right for me - may be it is for you.

<b>‚ùå The mistake would be choosing a stack for reasons that don't align with what you want in the future.</b>

## 2. Job Search
A few mistakes can make job search a very hectic process.
### üî∂ Terrible Resume/CV. 
Remember the majority of people who screen CVs/Resumes to determine who gets an interview are non-technical people looking for a few details to match the job description at hand. Make their work easy, make the relevant details easy to find. I'm talking of years of experience, your skills etc. Make sure those details don't get lost in a lot of text. Someone is sifting through 100s of resumes, a few seconds for each - no time to read through long paragraphs. <b>‚ùå The mistake most make is pouring too much detail in a resume, deep details should be reserved for interviews. A CV/Resume should be precise to land you an interview.</b>

### üî∂ Failure to network. 
Having a network of connections in the industry could really go a long way. It could mean the difference between a few weeks and several months to a job offer. <b>‚ùå It would be a mistake not to put some time into building a network or having a network but not leveraging it.</b>

### üî∂ Being inactive in the developer community. 
  - Contributing to open source
  - Writing technical articles
  - Answering questions on stackoverflow
  - Creating youtube tutorials or creating tutorials on blogs or wherever
  <br /><br />
  All the above and more are things you can do to stand out as a candidate to companies. <b>‚ùå It would be a mistake not to be any active in the developer community.</b>

  <br />

### üî∂ Not being interview ready. 
You want to be ready for interviews before sending out job applications. At the very least, start preparing immediately after sending out the first job application. You don't want to be unprepared when opportunity knocks. <b>‚ùå It would be a mistake not to prepare for opportunity.</b>

### üî∂ Not submitting a cover letter?

<br /><br />

## 3. Interview Prep
### üî∂ Going at it alone.
### üî∂ Not dedicating enough time to the process.

<br /><br />

## 4. Interviews
### üî∂ Not taking the chance to schedule the interview at own convenience.
### üî∂ Not setting up a good interviewing environment for self.
### üî∂ Failure to check internet, audio & video for remote interviews.
